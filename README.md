# Spatial Analytics EasySteps

This code contains everything you need to recreate the `EasySteps` tool. The tool is an R Shiny app that can be run directly from RStudio. 

The packages needed for installation are written in the markdown file, and access to OpenStreetMap is set up. The only additional part needed to do by users is set their own working directory in the first code chunk, and create an access token for MapBox API which can be created here: (https://www.mapbox.com/).

Once the access token has been created, simply paste it in where the code asks. The code has already been created to stay well within the free tier restrictions of MapBoxAPI. 

You can view an example of how the `EasySteps` tool works below.
